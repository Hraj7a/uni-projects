This Python project tracks and analyzes sales performance for a chain of retail stores. It uses file handling, data processing, and conditional logic to give insights into store sales and profitability from 2018 to 2023.

The program reads data from three external text files: stores.txt, sales_data.txt, and costs.txt. It organizes the data into dictionaries so it's easy to access by store ID. For example, read_stores() loads basic store details like name and location, and read_sales() loads yearly sales data per store.

The main functionality is menu-based. Users can:

1. View the average annual sales for each store using data from the past six years.

2. Calculate and log the profit of a store in a given year, considering both sales and costs.

3. Identify the top 3 stores with the highest total sales.

4. Rate each store from 1 to 5 stars based on average monthly sales.

It also creates or updates a file called store_profit.txt to save calculated profits. The program uses functions like sum(), file I/O (open, readline, write), loops, conditional statements, and exception handling to make sure everything runs smoothly.

In short, the project demonstrates basic data analysis with real-world business logic â€” cleanly structured, interactive, and based on actual sales data processing.
